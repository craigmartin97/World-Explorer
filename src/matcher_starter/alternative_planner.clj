(def operations
  "A map of operations that the agent can perform in the world

  The open operator will let the agent get from A-H or any other room quickly.
  However, it does not work if the goal is  (opened ?door true). This is because (in ?agent ?room1)
  is in the :when and not the :pre, so planner doesn't have a path to follow.

  Placing the (in ?agent ?room1) in the post will cause issues with the move operator.
  This is because it may assume that the agent is aiming to get to the wrong side of the door
  and get stuck on an infinite path trying to reach the agent, never realising it's a dead end."
